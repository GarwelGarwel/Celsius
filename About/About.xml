	<description>Adds realistic simulation of thermodynamics to the game.
	
	Main features:
	
	- Temperature is tracked and accurately represented for every map cell (instead of room-wide as in vanilla). For instance, air near fire is warmer; caves provide naturally stable temperature etc.
	
	- Certain items and buildings have their own temperature that gradually changes with surrounding air.
	
	- Water freezes and ice melts.
	
	- Highly flammable things may spontaneously ignite when it gets extremely hot.
	
	Celsius opens up many new challenges and ways to play RimWorld. You can warm your colonists by the campfire outside, melt ice sheets or unleash deadly firestorms on your enemies.
	
	The mod is pretty well optimized for performace and shouldn't visibly slow down the game. Still, you may disable or tweak almost any part of it to your liking.
