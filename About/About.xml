	<description>Celsius adds realistic simulation of thermodynamics to the game.

Main features:

- Temperature is tracked and accurately represented for every map cell (instead of room-wide as in vanilla) based on real-world thermal properties. For instance, air near fire is warmer; caves and bodies of water provide naturally stable environment etc.

- Water freezes and ice melts.

- Flammable things may spontaneously ignite when it gets extremely hot.

- The mod comes with a handy heat map to quickly sea hot and cold spots.

Celsius opens up many new challenges and ways to play RimWorld. Abandon houses and warm colonists at a campfire, melt ice sheets or unleash deadly firestorms on your enemies!

The mod is well optimized for performance and shouldn't noticeably slow down the game. Nevertheless, you may disable or tweak almost any part of it to your liking.

You can install it in an ongoing game; removal mid-game is also theoretically possible but untested.

DLCs are supported. Mods support is an ongoing effort. Mod authors can provide patches on their side or submit PRs in Github.
